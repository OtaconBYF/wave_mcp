## Configuration

### Claude Desktop Setup

Add the server to your Claude Desktop configuration:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wave-accounting": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/wave_mcp/mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "WAVE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_wave_oauth2_access_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving the configuration.

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Expense from a Receipt

```
I have a receipt from Office Depot for $45.99 dated March 15, 2024. 
It's for office supplies - printer paper and pens.
```

### Creating Income from Payment

```
Received payment of $1,500 from ABC Company on March 20, 2024 
for consulting services invoice #1234.
```

### Listing Available Accounts

```
Show me my expense accounts in Wave.
```

### Setting Active Business (Multi-Business Accounts)

```
List my Wave businesses and set the active one.
```

## Available MCP Tools

### Expense Management
- **`create_expense_from_receipt`**: Create expenses from receipt text
- **`search_vendor`**: Search for existing vendors
- **`get_expense_accounts`**: List available expense accounts

## Important Notes

### Vendor and Customer Management
- Vendors and customers must be created manually in Wave's web interface
- The API supports searching existing vendors/customers but not creating new ones
- Transactions can be created without vendors/customers and linked later

### Limitations
- Wave API doesn't support attaching receipt images/PDFs
- Maximum 2 simultaneous API requests (Wave rate limiting)
- OAuth2 tokens may expire and need refreshing

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Currently no test suite - testing via Claude Desktop integration
python mcp_server.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Wave client not initialized"
- Verify your `WAVE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set correctly
- Check that the token has valid permissions

### "No business selected"
- Use the `list_businesses` tool to see available businesses
- Set the active business with `set_business`

### MCP Server Not Available in Claude
- Ensure the path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is absolute
- Verify Python and all dependencies are installed
- Restart Claude Desktop
